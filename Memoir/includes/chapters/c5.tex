\section{Conclusion}
	\paragraph{}
	The work done has been beneficial to us as computer science students. We have tried to meet the needs of the problem, which we feel we have succeeded in doing.
	\paragraph{}
	During the process of this work, we had the idea to implement an informative web page for the conferences, and then we had the courage to go further, to realize a web page for the signaling of the conferences but also to make the management of the registrations from the beginning to the end. We are sure that we have achieved an acceptable result, but we must point out that the fact of making a paying conference has led us to face problems of money management, something we have done modestly and we hope that other students will be able to do it.
