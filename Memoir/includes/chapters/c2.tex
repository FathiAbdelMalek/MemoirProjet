\section{Presentation of the project frameworks}
	\subsection{What ?}
		\paragraph{}
		Our project is based on a website of representing conferences and submission to them, when the organizer of the conference put information about his conference like his title and some descriptions, and any one can see this conference in the web site, but only registered scholars and researchers can submit to it via sending their information to this organizer and wait to his acceptance and confirmation.
	\subsection{Why ?}
		\paragraph{}
		The main problem is that there is no website to represent a conference and let scholars submit in it at the same time, so the conference is in a separated website like ieee.org or in a specific domain like icrami.faox.dk. Meanwhile the scholar publish his paper in another website like easychair.org, so there is no platform in the network that let them all publish everything in the same place.
	\subsection{How ?}
		\paragraph{}
		We want to create a website that let any organizer of a conference to publish his information like the title, important dates (conference date, submission deadline, confirmation deadline, payment deadline), place, price... etc. Meanwhile any scholar or researcher can submit to it directly from the same web site, by sending to the organizer his information (name, email to contact, abstract of his work, and maybe the work itself, the authors... etc). but first they should be registered in this site.
		\paragraph{}
		There is some rules to submit, the scholar should demand a submission in a conference before the end of his submission deadline, and the organizer can't accept it immediately, he should wait until the beginning of confirmation deadline, when he accept a scholar, he will get a notification and an email to paid for the submission before end of payment deadline, or he will pay a larger price, he take a screen shot of the payment ticket and send it to the organizer and wait his confirmation.
